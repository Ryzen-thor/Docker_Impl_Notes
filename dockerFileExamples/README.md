I have created the simple docker image with the help of Dockerfile. We can refer the Dockerfile and understand what we did.
Now once Dockerfile is there to crete iamge out of it we need command "docker build -t myIamge ."
This will create the image we can check it by "docker images"
Finally to run it write the commmand "docker run -it imagenameorid"
